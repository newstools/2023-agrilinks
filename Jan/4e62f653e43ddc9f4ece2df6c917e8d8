Experience has shown that the private sector is not always interested in or prioritizes the same results or development impacts USAID aims to achieve through their partnerships, including those around gender equality and women’s empowerment. While it may not always be easy, finding common ground is an essential part of creating alignment and shared value. Below are three ideas on how to identify and align private sector and development interests for inclusion and empowerment. “You can’t fabricate the private sector’s desires. You need to find those who find it beneficial to their business to have women incorporated.” — Jorge Reyes, USAID/Honduras. “Try to find that place where profit meets inclusivity.” — Martha Albanese, USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (formerly with USAID/Colombia) These examples show that finding common ground around elevating women and youth through private sector partnerships is possible. While private sector and agricultural systems contexts differ greatly across countries, these ideas and examples can help USAID Missions to build sustainable partnerships with the private sector to advance inclusion and women’s empowerment.
