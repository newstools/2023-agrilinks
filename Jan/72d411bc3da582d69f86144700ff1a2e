As part of Livestock Month on Agrilinks, we want to hear from you! We want to know what you hope to learn more about and any lingering questions or insights you may have regarding livestock and development. Please list your questions or comments below, and we will craft a synthesis document that collates answers to your questions and insights that we will share by early February. Thank you so much for your interest and for helping us build this community of knowledge sharing!
