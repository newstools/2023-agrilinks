As one component of the USAID-funded Feed the Future Market Systems and Partnerships (MSP) Activity, MSP facilitates private-sector partnerships through a global Partnership Facility that creates shared value from the alignment of core business objectives and development goals. As of December 2022, MSP has seven active partnership facilities through buy-ins with USAID Missions and Washington with a combined value of $17.1 million. From December 12-16, 2022, MSP launched a social media partnership week in order to 1) highlight the inspiring private sector partners with which MSP works around the world, 2) tell the story of the impact that USAID's co-investment is having through these partnerships and 3) share knowledge on MSPs that are tailored to private sector engagement. The week’s theme was how the co-development process creates greater shared value — both for the firm and for development impact. The attached PDF is a compilation of the five posts from the week. The partners featured during the social media week come from the Southern Africa Agricultural Trade and Investment Activity with USAID Southern Africa Regional Mission, the Cambodia Agricultural Investment Activity with USAID/Cambodia Mission and the Solomon Islands Partnership Facility with USAID/Philippines Mission.
